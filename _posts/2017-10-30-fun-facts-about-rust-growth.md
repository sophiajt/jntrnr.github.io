* While some may see Rust as largely Mozilla-driven, the Rust core team is actually made of folks from four different companies.

* On a personal note, I've been pleasantly surprised that each Rusty Spike episode has gotten [over 500 listens](https://twitter.com/jntrnr/status/924337748047048704), even though it's new.

* This is the place-holder for a lot of stuff we can't talk about being done by companies you might know. Wish we could talk about it!

* Outreach to companies is exclusively grass roots by engineers in those companies promoting Rust and asking people to present.

* Rust is growing in importance in infosec. Projects like Tor have already begun [moving code to Rust](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/tor-browser-will-feature-more-rust-code/).

* [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust) is well worth a shout-out. If you ever wonder about what's good in the Rust world, check it out.
